followmejs-firebase
===================

Followmejs using firebase on Google App Engine.


Here is my link for Box Hackathon, where I develped this: <a href="http://redefiningwork.hackathon.io/teams/view/568" target="_blank">Followmejs</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mRrbkbTZFc" target="_blank">Here is the video for this demonstration</a>

If you wanna try this:

Open http://followmejs.appspot.com/ in as many browsers and devices and possible.

Now open the presenation remote : http://followmejs.appspot.com/r in any browser or mobile and swipe or click next and every one will just follow you.

Just in case, if you are experencing any glitches, someone else might be accessing the same presentation remote.
